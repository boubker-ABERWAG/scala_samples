   * The first case matches if x refers to the integer value 1.

   * The third case consists of a typed pattern;

   * Scalaâ€™s pattern matching statement is most useful for matching on algebraic types expressed via case classes.
   * Scala also allows the definition of patterns independently of case classes, using unapply methods in extractor objects.
